README:
  Carefull to typos (ie. accoing => according :] )
 
General Comments:
  I would have expected a minimal indication on how to make the code work.
  This means for instance:

  An example on how to run the program is:
    mpirun -np 4 env OMP_NUM_THREADS=2 ./main timeFileName gridSize

- I would not put the exact solution in the constructor of the solver


Code is well written and working amazingly well: very GOOD!
